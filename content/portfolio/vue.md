  - intro: "Starting with Vue 2 and transitioning to Vue 3, I’ve gained a deep understanding of Vue.js and its evolving ecosystem. My focus is on building performant, modular applications, leveraging Vue's reactivity and component-based architecture. I ensure seamless user experiences through dynamic data binding, efficient routing, and reusable components. With a strong foundation in integrating Vue with various tech stacks, I develop scalable, maintainable solutions that align with both user and business needs."
  - name: "Reactive Data Binding"
    description: "Vue’s reactivity system ensures the UI stays in sync with underlying data, whether using ref() for primitives or reactive() for complex objects. I leverage this system to create dynamic interfaces that respond instantly to user input without manual DOM manipulation. Understanding the nuances of both methods, I apply them based on the specific data requirements, ensuring efficient, scalable and  maintainable code."

  - name: "Component System"
    description: "Vue’s component architecture allows for highly modular code. I use props for one-way data binding, ensuring proper type validation and $emit to trigger custom events for parent-child communication. I often leverage scoped slots for flexible content distribution and provide/inject when managing deeper component hierarchies. This method ensures components remain decoupled, maintainable, and scalable."

  - name: "Directives"
    description: "Vue's directives, such as v-bind, v-if, and v-for, enable efficient DOM manipulation without manual updates. I use v-bind to handle dynamic attributes and v-if for optimizing conditional rendering by minimizing unnecessary re-renders. For large data sets, v-for is key in handling efficient rendering of lists. Additionally, I've developed custom directives to encapsulate complex DOM interactions, enhancing code reusability and clarity."

  - name: "Computed properties"
    description: "Computed properties allow for efficient, cached calculations based on reactive data. I use computed properties to handle complex logic that depends on reactive state, ensuring the UI updates efficiently without unnecessary recalculations. By using them alongside watchers, I maintain clean and optimized code and enhanced responsiveness."

  - name: "Lyfecycles"
    description: "Vue's lifecycle hooks provide full control over component behavior during its creation, update, and destruction phases. I frequently use hooks like mounted() to trigger actions after DOM rendering, beforeUpdate() for optimization, and beforeUnmount() for cleanup tasks."
