<h2 class="TestClass SecondTestClass">Vue 3 nad Nuxt</h2>

<p>Starting with Vue 2 and transitioning to Vue 3, I’ve gained a deep understanding of Vue.js and its evolving ecosystem. My focus is on building performant, modular applications, leveraging Vue's **reactivity** and component-based architecture.
<br>
I ensure seamless user experiences through dynamic data binding, efficient routing, and reusable components. With a strong foundation in integrating Vue with various tech stacks, I develop scalable, maintainable solutions that align with both user and business needs.</p>

<h2 id="TestID">Reactive Data Binding</h2>
<p>Vue’s reactivity system ensures the UI stays in sync with underlying data, whether using ref() for primitives or reactive() for complex objects. I leverage this system to create dynamic interfaces that respond instantly to user input without manual DOM manipulation. 

Understanding the nuances of both methods, I apply them based on the specific data requirements, ensuring efficient, scalable and  maintainable code.</p>
