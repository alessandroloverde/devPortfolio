  - intro: "I am an experienced developer with a deep understanding of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). My expertise spans a range of advanced techniques that enhance the efficiency and maintainability of stylesheets. Below, I highlight five key areas where my proficiency in SASS has made a significant impact on my development work."
  - name: "Advanced Functions"
    description: "I like SASS very much; I think it has lots of wonderful possibilities, if you scratch the surface a bit. Mastering funtions not only allows you to keep your code DRY and well-organized but it gives big room for creativity and, why not... fun"

  - name: "Advanced Mixins"
    description: "I leverage SASS mixins to simplify and automate responsive design. In the code example my mixin for generating responsive column offsets, allows for automatic creation of classes for various breakpoints. This approach significantly reduces repetitive code and makes the layout system adaptable to different devices."

  - name: "SVG Animations"
    description: "Surely there are some very good libraries around for animating SVGs but if you want to hand-craft them for a better control and less headaches with your existing codebase, SASS is surely a must for handling interval-staggering and color morph without bloating and cluttering your code"
