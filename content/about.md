<span class="special inlineIcon--layers"></span>My journey began quite long ago, as a Web Designer, where I followed the evolution from static websites to modern, dynamic, and responsive web apps. This solid foundation in design has given me a deep understanding of UI, UX, and design principles, which I now seamlessly integrate into my dev workflow to create intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

My current tech stack includes **Vue.js**, JavaScript **(ES6)**, **TypeScript**, and **SASS**. I have extensive experience with Nuxt.js for building robust, server-side rendered applications and use Jest for unit testing to ensure my code is reliable and of high quality.

Thanks to my background in Web Design, I have a strong grasp on **Responsive Design** and **Cross-browser Compatibility**, ensuring web applications are accessible and function seamlessly across all devices and platforms. I follow **WCAG 2.1** accessibility guidelines to create inclusive experiences for all users.

I've always worked in collaborative teams with tools like **GIT**, **Git Flow**, and **Jira**. I also have hands-on experience with **Supabase**, **Chart.js**, **Google Maps API**, and **Headless CMS** like **Prismic** and **NuxtContent**, integrating complex data visualizations and dynamic content management into my projects.

With a strong passion for frontend, I am constantly exploring new technologies, optimizing workflows, choosing new tools for creating impactful and flawless user experiences. Whether optimizing performance or designing intuitive UIs, I bring a blend of design expertise and technical skill to every project I work on.
