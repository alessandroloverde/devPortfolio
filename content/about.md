My journey began quite long ago, as a Web Designer, where I witnessed the evolution from static websites to modern, dynamic, and responsive web apps. This solid foundation in design has given me a deep understanding of UI, UX, and design principles, which I now seamlessly integrate into my dev workflow to create intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

My current tech stack includes **Vue.js**, JavaScript **(ES6)**, **TypeScript**, and **SASS**. I have extensive experience with Nuxt.js for building robust, server-side rendered applications and use Jest for unit testing to ensure my code is reliable and of high quality.

Thanks to my background in Web Design, I have a strong grasp on **Responsive Design** and **Cross-browser Compatibility**, ensuring web applications are accessible and function seamlessly across all devices and platforms. I take pride in following **WCAG 2.1** accessibility guidelines to create inclusive experiences for all users.

I thrive in collaborative, international teams and have worked with tools like **GIT**, **Git Flow**, and **Supabase**. I also have hands-on experience with **Chart.js**, **Google Maps API**, and **Headless CMS**, integrating complex data visualizations and dynamic content management into my projects.

Passionate about the web, I am constantly exploring new technologies, optimizing workflows, and focusing on creating impactful user experiences. Whether optimizing performance or designing intuitive UIs, I bring a blend of design expertise and technical skill to every project I work on.
